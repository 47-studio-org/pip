When installing projects with a ``pyproject.toml`` in editable mode, and the build
backend does not support :pep:`660`, prepare metadata using
``prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel`` instead of ``setup.py egg_info``. Also, refuse
installing projects that only have a ``setup.cfg`` and no ``setup.py`` nor
``pyproject.toml``. These restore the pre-21.3 behaviour.
