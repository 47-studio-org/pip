Changed ``PackageFinder`` to parse HTML documents using the stdlib :class:`html.parser.HTMLParser` class instead of the ``html5lib`` package.

For now, the deprecated ``html5lib`` code remains and can be used with the ``--use-deprecated=html5lib`` command line option. However, it will be removed in a future pip release.
